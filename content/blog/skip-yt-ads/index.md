# Skip any YouTube Ad like a pro in 2sec(No BS)

While casually browsing through YouTube on my Mobile, I accidentally stumbled on a workaround to skip the annoying **ads** that YouTube makes us watch(if we don't have a Premium A/c).

It only takes about a second or two to skip an ad with the method I've described below :

## Testing

1. Open **YouTube App** on you mobile device.
2. **Click on a Video** that you think will definitely have an Ad.
3. When the Ad starts playing, **tap on** _YouTube Shorts_ section in the bottom navigation.

> Opening the _YouTube Shorts_ section while playing a video doesn't close the Video player.

5. Tap the **go-back** button on your device as soon the shorts section becomes active.
6. Voila, the ad has been skipped! You can resume your video where you left it.

> You can open & close any nearby YouTube Short video for this to work.

Note: If you don't see any YouTube Short Videos in your app - I recommend you [update the app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.youtube) and check again.

## Video Demo

Here's a video demo of skipping the Ad:

## Something else I noticed ü§î

After doing this trick, YouTube doesn't show Ads for a significant amount of time. Maybe this is just me. ÔººÔºà„Äá\_ÔΩèÔºâÔºè

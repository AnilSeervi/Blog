Hello folks! It's been a while since I published an article. I was working on this very own <Link to="/">Blog site</Link> itself.

To continue with the _Higher-Order Functions_ series, I'll be explaining Array `reduce()` method in this article.

`Array.reduce()` is a bit hard to grasp at the beginning as compared to other Higher-Order Array methods like `map()`, `forEach()`, `filter()`, etc.

`reduce()` is just another HOF like the above mentioned methods, but what makes it difficult to understand is that it's _signature/syntax_ and working logic is a bit different from the others.

```js
reduce(callbackFn, initialValue)
```

## What does the `Array.reduce()` method do?

`reduce()` method executes the user-supplied "reducer" `callbackFn` on each Array element, in order, passing the return value from the callback as the _first parameter_ to the next iteration. And the result of the method is a single value returned by the last iteration.

### Syntax

```js
reduce(callbackFn, initialValue)
reduce((previousValue, currentValue, currentIndex, array) => {
  /* ... */
}, initialValue)
```

#### Parameters

`callbackFn`  
A reducer function that executes on each element. It accepts one to four arguments :

- `previousValue` : The value returned from the previous `callbackFn`. On the first call, `intialValue` if specified, otherwise the value of `array[0]`.
- `currentValue` : The value of current element. On the first call, the value of `array[0]` if an `intialValue` is specified, otherwise the value of `array[1]`.
- `currentIndex` : The index position of `currentValue` in the array. On the first call, `0` if `initialValue` is specified, otherwise `1`.
- `array` : The array itself that is traversed over.

`initialValue` (_optional_)  
A value to which `previousValue` is initialized on the first call. If `initialValue` is specified, it causes the `currentValue` to be initialized with the first element in the array(`array[0]`). If `initialValue` is not specified, `previousValue` is initialized to the first element in the array(`array[0]`) and the `currentValue` is initialized to the second element in the array(`array[1]`).

> Note: Sometimes`previousValue` is also referred to as `accumulator` as in _horse racing accumulator bets_.

#### Return Value

A single return value that results on running the "reducer" `callbackFn` to completion over the entire array. The return value from the last iteration of the `callbackFn` is the **Return value** of the entire method.

### Simple Examples

##### 1. Sum of Array elements is a good example to start with to understand `reduce()`.

```js{3}
const arr = [5, 3, 6, 1]

const sum = arr.reduce((prev, item) => prev + item)
// sum -> 15
```

In the above snippet there's no `initialValue` defined, so the reducer starts with `arr[0]` being the `prev`(`previousValue`) and `arr[1]` as the value of `item`(`currentValue`) in the first iteration.

So the iterations for the reducer would look something like this without the `initialValue`.

| callbackFn iteration | previousValue | currentValue | currentIndex | Return Value |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| first call           | 5             | 3            | 1            | 8            |
| second call          | 8             | 6            | 2            | 14           |
| third call           | 14            | 1            | 3            | 15           |

For the _first call_, the value of `previousValue` is `arr[0]` and of `currentValue` is `arr[1]` as the `initialValue` wasn't specified. You can see that the `previousValue` for _second call_ is initialized with the **return value** of the _first call_. This pattern goes on until the last iteration is made and the return value from the last call is the **Return Value** for the method.

```js{1}
;[5, 3, 6, 1].reduce((prev, item) => prev + item, 7) // 22
```

The iterations looks something like this when the `initialValue` is passed to the method.

| callbackFn iteration | previousValue | currentValue | currentIndex | Return Value |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| first call           | 7             | 5            | 0            | 12           |
| second call          | 12            | 3            | 1            | 15           |
| third call           | 15            | 6            | 2            | 21           |
| fourth call          | 21            | 1            | 3            | 22           |

The _first call_ starts with `initialValue` initialized to `previousValue` and the value of `arr[0]` initialized to `currentValue`.

✨ Fun little tip that I used to do before I learnt reduce was to use `eval()`.

```js
eval([1, 2, 3, 4, 5].join`+`) // 15
```

Use at your own risk !!

##### 2. Grand total of a grocery list

Let's say you were given an array of objects, of which objects contain

- `name` as _string_
- `quantity` as _number_ in **KGs** and
- `price` as _number_ in **$Dollars** per `quantity`

and you are needed to produce the grand total of the items. How would you go about finding it using `reduce()`?

```js{19,20,21,22}
const groceries = [
  {
    name: "Tomatoes🍅",
    price: 3.0,
    quantity: 3,
  },
  {
    name: "EggPlant🍆",
    price: 4.5,
    quantity: 5.1,
  },
  {
    name: "Broccoli🥦",
    price: 2.3,
    quantity: 0.6,
  },
]

const grandTotal = groceries.reduce((prev, item) => {
  const total = item.price * item.quantity
  return prev + total
}, 0)
// 33.33
```

An `initialValue` is provided to the `reduce()` method so the `currentValue` is going to start with `groceries[0]`. For the _first call_, the `total` will evaluate to `3.0*3`=`9` which is then summed with the `previousValue` a returned. The same pattern is followed until the last(_third call_) is made and the `grandTotal` results to `33.33`.

### More examples

Let's have a look at a bit complex examples with `reduce()`.

##### 1. Count items in an Array

Q. Given an array of string, count the number of occurrences of an item in the array ?

```js{3,4,5,6}
const arr = ["foo", "bar", "foo"]

const counts = arr.reduce((acc, item) => {
  if (acc.has(item)) return acc.set(item, acc.get(item) + 1)
  else return acc.set(item, 1)
}, new Map())
// counts -> {'foo' => 2, 'bar' => 1}
```

The output would have much sense if it would be in some form of object with the array items being the keys and the corresponding values being the number of occurrences of the item. I used a `Map()` because of the helpful methods that it has to check and set items.

In the _first call_ the reducer is set with an `initialValue` of an empty `Map()` which is initialized to `acc` and the `item` is initialized with `arr[0]`. The _map_ is checked if it contains the `item`, if it does, the value of the key is incremented. Otherwise in the else part, the map is set with `item` as the key with value of count to `1`.

##### 2. Maximum by field

Q. Given an array of objects with some numerical property, find the object with the maximum value ?

```js{7,8,9,10}
const objects = [
  { name: "foo", value: 123 },
  { name: "bar", value: 100 },
  { name: "baz", value: 150 },
]

const maxValueObject = objects.reduce((acc, object) => {
  if (acc.value > object.value) return acc
  else return object
})
// maxValueObject -> { name : 'baz', value: 150 }
```

There is no `initialValue` defined for the reducer because all we need to do is compare the field of the object with the `acc` and return the object with maximum value to the `acc`, through which only the object with the maximum value stays in the `acc` getting compared with other objects until a maximum field value replaces it.

##### 3. Grouping by similar value

Q. Given an array of objects with type and value keys, group the array according to the type with values.

```js{7,9,10,11,12,13,14}
const obj = [
  { type: "a", value: 123 },
  { type: "a", value: 100 },
  { type: "b", value: 150 },
]

const group = obj.reduce((acc, item) => {
  // check if the key exists
  if (!acc[item.type]) {
    acc[item.type] = [] // if not create the key initialized with empty array
  }
  acc[item.type].push(item.value) // push the value to the existing array of the key
  return acc // return the who object to next iteration
}, {})
// group -> { a: [123, 100], b: [150] }
```

#### Is this the End of the <u>Higher-Order Function</u> Series ?

Probably :)

Array methods such as `forEach()`, `map()` and `filter()` are some of the _Higher Order **Array** Functions_ that come in very handy when you have to work with data that's in an Array.

In this article we'll be discussing the following Higher-Order Functions, with examples :

- `forEach()`
- `map()`
- `filter()`

I'll be assuming that you have a basic understanding of what _Higher-Order Functions_ are and how to work with them, **if not**, I recommend you read my <Link to="/blog/HOF-in-js">previous article</Link> on it.

## `Array.forEach()`

`forEach()` method is very useful to perform certain operation(s) for every element in the Array.

The `forEach()` method on an Array executes the provided _callback function_ for each element in the array in ascending index(starting 0).

### Syntax

```js
forEach(callbackFn)
forEach((element, index, array) => {
  /* ... */
})
```

#### Parameters

`callbackFn`  
Function to execute on each element. It accepts one to three arguments :

`element` : The current element being processed in the array.  
`index` : The index of `element` in array.  
`array` : The array on which `forEach()` was called upon.

The `forEach()` method doesn't return anything : `undefined`

If you look at the signature of the callback function in this method, it looks similar to the `forEach()` function that I created in the previous <Link to="/blog/HOF-in-js">**Higher-Order Functions**</Link> article.

---

### Examples

Let's recreate the same example now using the `Array.forEach()` method :

```js{3,8}
const numbs = [5, 9, 10, 1] // Array of numbers

numbs.forEach((n, i, arr) => {
  // n => element, i => index, arr => array(numbs)
  arr[i] = n + 2 // add 2 to current element
})

numbs.forEach(n => console.log(n)) // logs all element one-by-one
// 7
// 11
// 12
// 3
```

As the `forEach()` is a method on the array itself, we can call it on any array using the [_dot notation_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_accessors#dot_notation).

In the above example we've called `Array.forEach()` _Higher-Order function_ twice with arrow functions as callbacks, defined right withing `forEach()`'s parameters.

---

Say we have an Array of full names and you are required to separate all the full names into `firstName` and `lastName` of an object and push them into an array that already contains same kind-of data. How'd you do it?

```js
const fullNames = [
  "Adam Benson",
  "Clare Donaldson",
  "Ben Adams",
  "Donald Clarkson",
]
```

Here's how you can use the `forEach()` to push objects containing `firstName` and `lastName` property to the `names` array.

```js{3}
const names = [{ firstName: "Anil", lastName: "Seervi" }]

fullNames.forEach(n => {
  const obj = {} // empty object for initialization
  [obj.firstName, obj.lastName] = n.split` ` // split at spaces and destructure initialize
  names.push(obj) // push the object to names array
})

console.log(names)
/*
[
  { firstName: 'Anil', lastName: 'Seervi' }
  { firstName: 'Adam', lastName: 'Benson' },
  { firstName: 'Clare', lastName: 'Donaldson' },
  { firstName: 'Ben', lastName: 'Adams' },
  { firstName: 'Donald', lastName: 'Clarkson' }
]
*/
```

In the above example, within our callback, we create an empty object `obj` to store the properties. Then we split the current element of the array at spaces, destructure it right away storing it to properties `firstName` and `lastName` in the object `obj`. At last we push the object into the `names` array.

---

## `Array.map()`

`Array.map()` method comes very handy when you have to create a new array from executing a certain function on an existing array.

The `Array.map()` method on an Array returns a new array populated with the return value of the _callback function_ called for every element in an array in ascending index(starting 0).

### Syntax

```js
map(callbackFn)
map((element, index, array) => {
  /* ... */
})
// returns a new array populated with results of callbackFn
```

#### Parameters

`callbackFn`  
Function to execute on each element of `arr`. Each time `callbackFn` executes, the return value is added to the `newArray`.
It accepts one to three arguments :

`element` : The current element being processed in the array.  
`index` : The index of `element` in array.  
`array` : The array on which `map()` was called upon.

#### Return value

The `map()` method returns a **new Array** with each element being the result of the callback function.

---

### Examples

Let's assume we are given the following array and are told to produce another array of consisting of the sqaures of all the respective elements.

```js
const numbs = [5, 9, 10, 1] // our boring array of numbers
```

The easiest way to do this will be by using the `Array.map()` method :

```js{1}
const squares = numbs.map(n => n ** 2)
// Yes, its easy as that!!

console.log(numbs)
// [ 5, 9, 10, 1 ]
console.log(sqaures)
// [ 25, 81, 100, 1 ]
```

That was so easy right. All we need to do is to call the `map()` method on our `numbs` array and return the square of the current element within it for our logic. As the `map()` method itself returns a new Array, we store it in the variable `sqaures`.

---

Now let's look at another example where we'll convert an array of objects with `firstName` and `lastName` properties that we got as our output in the `forEach()` and create another array which will consist of only full names. Kinda the reverse of what we did in `forEach()` example.

```js{11}
// array of objects with firstName and lastName
const names = [
  { firstName: "Anil" },
  { firstName: "Adam", lastName: "Benson" },
  { firstName: "Clare", lastName: "Donaldson" },
  { firstName: "Ben", lastName: "Adams" },
  { firstName: "Donald", lastName: "Clarkson" },
]

// create a new Array of fullNames using names Array
const fullNames = names.map(name => {
  const full_name = `${name.firstName} ${name?.lastName || ""}`
  return full_name.trimEnd()
})

console.log(fullNames)
// [ 'Anil', 'Adam Benson', 'Clare Donaldson', 'Ben Adams', 'Donald Clarkson' ]
```

Above, the first thing you'll notice while looking at the example is we don't have `lastName` property for my name and our logic will have to handle that too.

Within the callback of our `map()` method we are using template literals to concatenate `firstName` and `lastName`(if any: using optional chaining) to form the `full_name`. And returning trimmed `full_name` from the callback.

## `Array.filter()`

As the name implies, this method is used to filter out the array which meets a certain condition.

`Array.filter()` method on the Array returns an new Array with only the elements that pass the test condition within the _callback function_.

### Syntax

```js
filter(callbackFn)
filter((element, index, array) => {
  /* ... */
})
// returns a new array with elements that satisfy the callback condition.
```

#### Parameters

`callbackFn`  
Function is a predicate to execute on each element of `arr`. Each time `callbackFn` is called, only the `element`'s that coerce to `true` are added into the new Array.
It accepts one to three arguments :

`element` : The current element being processed in the array.  
`index` : The index of `element` in array.  
`array` : The array on which `filter()` was called upon.

##### Return Value

The `filter()` method returns a **new Array** with only the elements that satisfy the test condition in the `callbackFn`.

### Examples

To keep it easier to understand I'm taking our same old `numbs` array to work on.

```js
const numbs = [5, 9, 10, 1, 6, 3] // hey, I'm bigger this time :)
```

lets pose a couple question so to `filter` our boring array.

Q1. _Obtain an array of **Odd Numbers** from `numbs`_

```js{1}
const odd = numbs.filter(n => n % 2 !== 0)

console.log(odd)
// [ 5, 9, 1, 3]
```

Within the callback, we return true only for _odd_ numbers in our array which in-turn returns all odd numbers in our `numbs` array.

Q2. _Obtain an array of **Prime Numbers** from `numbs`_

```js{7}
function isPrime(numb) {
  for (let i = 2, s = Math.sqrt(numb); i <= s; i++)
    if (numb % i === 0) return !1
  return numb > 1
}

console.log(numbs.filter(isPrime))
// [ 5, 3 ]
```

Here `isPrime` is our callback for `filter` method which gets called with every element in `numbs` and acts as our condition to filter out numbers that are _prime_.

Below is a composite example of both `map()` and `filter()` methods. I'm going to create an Array that'll contain names of my GitHub Repos which are majorly written with **SCSS**.

The example is an _async_ [`IIFE`(Immediately Invoked Function Expression)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE) Function that'll get _called as soon as it's defined_. Within our async function, I'm fetching the data related to my GitHub repos in JSON format using GitHub's REST API.

The API returns an Array of Objects that contain information about my public GitHub repositories listed alphabetically. You can see the response of the API by visiting the below URL:

- Maximum of 30 repos: https://api.github.com/users/AnilSeervi/repos
- All the repos : https://api.github.com/users/anilseervi/repos?per_page=100

> The API only returns a maximum of 30 repos without any query parameters.

```js{7,8}
;(async function jsRepos() {
  const res = await fetch(
    "https://api.github.com/users/AnilSeervi/repos?per_page=100"
  ) // fetch the JSON from API
  const data = await res.json() // parse JSON to JavaScript Object

  const filterJSRepos = data.filter(i => i.language === "SCSS") // filter the Repos based on language
  const repoNames = filterReposData.map(i => i.name) // Create an array of filtered Repo names

  console.log(repoNames)
  // ['DevFolio', 'mdn-minimalist', 'ts-portfolio']
})()
```

The response(in JSON) fetched from the **URL** is stored in `res` and then converted to a JavaScript Object that is stored in `data`.

> Note: The names and number of repos may change based on the time you are reading this.

Now we have an Array of objects of all the repos which we need to be filtered based on the `language` property. Objects whose language property is `SCSS` are filtered into `filterJSRepos` constant.

After filtering the Repos, we can now grab just the `name` property of the filtered Repos using `map()` and _voila_, there's our array that contains the names of my repos those majorly contain **SCSS**.
